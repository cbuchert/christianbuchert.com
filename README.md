# Read the source, Luke.
Well hello there! Glad to see you're interested in the source code of this website. I'm not sure why you'd want to, but I'm glad you're here. I'm going to assume you're a developer, so I'll try to keep this as simple as possible.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
